# Fingertip-Photoplethysmography

Software for detecting the heart beats based on a PPG signal measured in the finger.
This software is part of a project for university (Signal Acquisition Instrumentation in Bioengineering course) where a physical fingertip photoplethysmography had to be developed from scratch. Here, only the software part of the project is shown.

The signal is measured in the finger and is then filtered and amplified before beeing fed into an Arduino analog input channel from where it is then processed using this software.
